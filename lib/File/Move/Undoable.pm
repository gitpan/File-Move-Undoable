If moving to the same filesystem, will move using `rename()`. On undo will
restore the old name.

If moving to a different filesystem, will copy to `target` using `rsync` and
then trash `source`. On undo, will trash `target` and restore `source` from
trash.

Fixed state: `source` does not exist and `target` exists. Content or sizes are
not checked; only existence.

Fixable state: `source` exists and `target` doesn't exist.

Unfixable state: `source` does not exist, or both `source` and `target` exist
(unless we are moving to a different filesystem, in which it means an
interrupted transfer and thus fixable).

Note that to avoid ambiguity, you must specify full location instead of just
directory name. For example: mv(source=>'/dir', target=>'/a') will move /dir to
/a and mv(source=>'/dir', target=>'/a/dir') will move /dir to /a/dir.

            description => <<'_',

By default, `-a` is used. You should not use rsync options that modify or
destroy source, like `--remove-source-files` as it will make recovery of
interrupted move impossible.

=head1 NAME

File::Move::Undoable - Move file/directory using rename/rsync, with undo support

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 FAQ

=head2 Why do you use rsync? Why not, say, File::Copy::Recursive?

With C<rsync>, we can continue interrupted transfer. We need this ability for
recovery. Also, C<rsync> can handle hardlinks and preservation of ownership,
something which L<File::Copy::Recursive> currently does not do. And, being
implemented in C, it might be faster when processing large files/trees.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Setup>

L<Rinci::Transaction>

=head1 DESCRIPTION


This module has L<Rinci> metadata.

=head1 FUNCTIONS


None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

=head2 mv(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]

Move file/directory using rename/rsync, with undo support.

If moving to the same filesystem, will move using C<rename()>. On undo will
restore the old name.

If moving to a different filesystem, will copy to C<target> using C<rsync> and
then trash C<source>. On undo, will trash C<target> and restore C<source> from
trash.

Fixed state: C<source> does not exist and C<target> exists. Content or sizes are
not checked; only existence.

Fixable state: C<source> exists and C<target> doesn't exist.

Unfixable state: C<source> does not exist, or both C<source> and C<target> exist
(unless we are moving to a different filesystem, in which it means an
interrupted transfer and thus fixable).

This function is idempotent (repeated invocations with same arguments has the same effect as single invocation). This function supports transactions.


Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

=over 4

=item * B<rsync_opts> => I<array> (default: ["-a"])

Rsync options.

By default, C<-a> is used. You should not use rsync options that modify or
destroy source, like C<--remove-source-files> as it will make recovery of
interrupted move impossible.

=item * B<source>* => I<str>

=item * B<target>* => I<str>

Target location.

Note that to avoid ambiguity, you must specify full location instead of just
directory name. For example: mv(source=>'/dir', target=>'/a') will move /dir to
/a and mv(source=>'/dir', target=>'/a/dir') will move /dir to /a/dir.

Special arguments:

=item * B<-tx_action_id> => I<str>

For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

=item * B<-tx_recovery> => I<str>

For more information on transaction, see L<Rinci::Transaction>.

=item * B<-tx_rollback> => I<str>

Return value:

Returns an enveloped result (an array). First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta) is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra information.
